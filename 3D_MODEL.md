# `car-hub` 3D Model

We designed an model for the most of the `car-hub` components, allowing us to control the positioning of the camera and sensors. The CAD was done with Onshape - this is a link to the CAD file: https://cad.onshape.com/documents/ff3f046014a14859b9dc7f1a/w/8592ab82e4aacaf329c68fc0/e/735e1cc97c94fbe96f8f14db?renderMode=0&uiState=673a1a7c60d000766f8438e4.
