# car-hub

This package is intended to run on a Raspberry Pi 4. The Pi 4 is in the car and interfaces with a UVC camera to take pictures. It also interfaces with a Pi Pico which has other sensors for detecting human presence in the car. The Pi 4 handles all commmunication from car inputs to the backend.
